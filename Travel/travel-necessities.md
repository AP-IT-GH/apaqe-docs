12. CCTV

## Minimum Requirements

* Fitted sheet
* Duvet cover (can be used as a blanket)
* Pillowcase
* New mosquito net (or mosquito tent if you fit inside)
  * If your room does not have a frame, you will need to construct something to hang your mosquito net (the fan is located in the middle of the room on the ceiling).
  * It is best to bring double-sided tape, hooks, and string (sometimes hooks are already available).
* Towels (for both the sea and shower)
* Kitchen towels
* The usual items (shower stuff, clothes, etc.)
  * Some long pants for KIST (or at least 3/4 length)
* Large ZIP bags – for your food (to prevent pests)
* Paper towels + toilet paper
* Mosquito repellent (recommended: mosquito spray with 50% DEET and electronic mosquito plug-in)
* UK plug to EU plug adapter (also bring power strips with EU plugs)
* Small bottle of dish soap + laundry detergent (for hand washing)
* Insect repellent for ants and cockroaches, if necessary
* Cash USD (it is best to request this from your bank – plan for around $1000)
  * Convert to TZS preferably at the airport **but** at the exchange office at the airport barrier, not right next to terminal 3 exit.
    * Exchange $200 right away
  * You will need a large wallet (many bills)
* Passport (apply in advance at your municipality)
* Visa is $50 upon arrival (keep a pen handy on the last flight to Zanzibar – there is paperwork)
  * 2 forms, 1 for registration and 1 for the visa (you will receive the visa form at the airport)

## Housekeeper – Mama

This lady is included in the house price. You just need to ask if you want her to do something for you (she has difficulty reading and does not speak English, use Google Translate and the speaker).

She will do the following:

* Washing dishes
* Cleaning
* Washing clothes

She can also cook, but you will have to pay extra for this. It is cheaper than eating out though.
However, it is recommended not to eat meat or only eat **boneless beef**. (meat is okay when in restaurants)

**And ask for a lot of sauce, otherwise, it may not be enough for everyone.**

### Food

The housekeeper can cook reasonably well, but you will need to pay for the ingredients you need to tell her what you want, otherwise, she won't cook. You can always ask the security guard if she can or can't make it. (she's not Gordon Ramsey)

It is recommended to make a list of food for the entire week, discuss it with the security guard, and then pay him day by day. He will use the leftovers from one day for the next.

Here are some items she can make well:

* Fruit juice
* Bread
* Chapati (pancake bread)
* Rice curry
* Rice tomato

#### Tips

You will easily find bread, but spreads are a problem. It is recommended to bring a jar of Nutella or similar. If not, you will have to come up with something as a group. (Nutella is quite expensive there but you can find it)

## Warning – Information

* Internet on campus and at home is slow – download everything you might need in advance.
* Do not leave clothes hanging outside at night – they may be stolen.
* Always lock doors when everyone is out – the security guard has the key to the stairway door and gate but is not home 24/7.
* Limit electricity usage – it runs out quickly (also not included in price).
* Go with as many people as possible once a week (or twice) to buy water – everyone carries two hands full.
  * Or ask for it to be delivered to the house – buy a lot at once.
* Do not expect paved roads, there are some but not everywhere.
  * Bring shoes that can get dirty and handle off-road terrain.
  * It will be warm, so keep this in mind.
