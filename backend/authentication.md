# Authentik

We use Authentik for authentication, which allows users to log in with their Microsoft Account, Google Account or Email and password. This provides a simple and secure way to access our applications without having to remember multiple usernames and passwords.

With Authentik, we can take advantage of the security and convenience of external authentication providers, while still maintaining control over access to our applications. This setup also enables us to easily add or remove authentication providers as needed, making it a flexible and scalable solution for our authentication needs.

**2. Centralized Control**\
 Authentik allows us to maintain control over access to our applications while benefiting from the security features of external providers. We can manage and enforce access policies centrally, ensuring that only authorized users can access our services.

**3. Flexibility and Scalability**\
 Authentikâ€™s design makes it easy to add or remove authentication providers as needed. This flexibility allows us to adapt to changing requirements and scale our authentication setup without significant reconfiguration.
