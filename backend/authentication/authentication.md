# Authentik

We use Authentik for authentication, which allows users to log in with their Microsoft Account or Google Account. This provides a convenient and secure way to access our applications without having to remember multiple usernames and passwords.

With Authentik, we can take advantage of the security and convenience of external authentication providers, while still maintaining control over access to our applications. This setup also enables us to easily add or remove authentication providers as needed, making it a flexible and scalable solution for our authentication needs.
