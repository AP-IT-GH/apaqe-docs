# Traefik

We have replaced Nginx with Traefik as our reverse proxy solution. Traefik is a modern, open-source reverse proxy and load balancer that is designed to work seamlessly with containerized applications.

#### Why Traefik?

**1. Automatic Certificate Management**\
Traefik integrates with Let's Encrypt, a free certificate authority, to automatically obtain and renew SSL/TLS certificates for our domain names. This ensures that our applications are always served over a secure connection without manual intervention.

**2. Easy Configuration**\
Traefik offers a simple and intuitive configuration format, making it easy to set up and manage application routing. Its declarative configuration approach streamlines the process, reducing potential errors and simplifying maintenance.

**3. Container-Friendly**\
Designed with containerized applications in mind, Traefik is a perfect fit for our Docker-based infrastructure. It natively integrates with Docker and other container orchestration platforms, automatically discovering and configuring services.

#### Benefits

By using Traefik, we can:

Simplify our infrastructure: Traefik's automatic service discovery and configuration reduce the need for manual setup.
Improve security: Automated SSL/TLS certificate management ensures our connections are always secure.
Reduce complexity: Traefik's user-friendly configuration and seamless integration with our container ecosystem streamline our application routing and management.
Switching to Traefik allows us to focus more on developing our applications while ensuring a secure, reliable, and efficient reverse proxy setup.
