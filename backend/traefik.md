# Traefik

We have replaced Nginx with Traefik as our reverse proxy solution. Traefik is a modern, open-source reverse proxy and load balancer that is designed to work seamlessly with containerized applications.

Why Traefik?
We chose Traefik for several reasons:

Automatic Certificate Management: Traefik integrates with Let's Encrypt, a free certificate authority, to automatically obtain and renew SSL/TLS certificates for our domain names. This ensures that our applications are always served over a secure connection.
Easy Configuration: Traefik provides a simple and intuitive configuration format that makes it easy to set up and manage our application routing.
Container-Friendly: Traefik is designed to work with containerized applications, making it a natural fit for our Docker-based infrastructure.
By using Traefik, we can simplify our infrastructure, improve security, and reduce the complexity of our application routing.
