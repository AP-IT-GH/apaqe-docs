# Weekly Standup

Weekly standups were a critical part of our project management process, helping us maintain alignment and ensure steady progress. Here's how we structured and conducted our weekly standups:

## Purpose

The main purpose of the weekly standup was to provide a regular forum for team members to share updates, discuss progress, and identify any obstacles. This practice helped us maintain clear communication, stay aligned on priorities, and quickly address any issues that arose.

## Structure

Our weekly standup meetings followed a structured format to keep them focused and efficient. Each meeting typically included the following components:

### 1. Quick Updates

Each team member provided a brief update on their progress since the last standup. This included:

- What they accomplished during the past week.
- What they are planning to work on in the coming week.
- Any challenges or blockers they are facing.

### 2. Review of Action Items

We reviewed the action items from the previous week to ensure they were completed or to understand why any were not. This helped us keep track of our commitments and ensure accountability.

### 3. Priority Setting

We discussed and set priorities for the upcoming week. This included aligning on key tasks and goals, and making sure everyone understood what needed to be done. We also adjusted priorities as needed based on any new information or changes in the project.

### 4. Issue Resolution

Any identified blockers or issues were addressed during the standup. We discussed possible solutions and assigned action items to resolve these issues promptly. This ensured that no team member was stuck and that progress could continue smoothly.

### 5. Open Discussion

Towards the end of the meeting, we had an open discussion segment where team members could bring up any other topics or concerns. This was a time for additional questions, ideas, or feedback that might not have been covered in the structured updates.

## Tools

We used several tools to facilitate our weekly standups:

- **Discord/Microsoft Teams**: For hosting the virtual meetings, ensuring that all team members could participate regardless of their location.
- **Notion**: To document meeting notes, action items, and updates. This ensured that we had a clear record of what was discussed and decided during the standup.
- **Kanban Board**: To visually track the progress of tasks and priorities. This helped us quickly see what was in progress, what was completed, and what needed attention.

## Benefits

Conducting regular weekly standups provided several benefits:

- **Enhanced Communication**: Regular updates kept everyone informed about the project's progress and any changes.
- **Increased Accountability**: Knowing that they would need to report on their progress each week helped team members stay on track with their tasks.
- **Quick Issue Resolution**: Identifying and addressing blockers promptly prevented delays and kept the project moving forward.
- **Aligned Priorities**: Regularly setting and reviewing priorities ensured that the team was always focused on the most important tasks.

By maintaining a consistent schedule for our weekly standups and following this structured approach, we were able to enhance our communication, collaboration, and overall project management.
