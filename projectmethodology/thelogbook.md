# Logbook

## Purpose

To ensure efficient use of time and resources, we maintained a logbook in Notion where each team member recorded their weekly session activities. This logbook was crucial for tracking progress, maintaining accountability, and optimizing resource allocation.

## Implementation

We used Notion to create a structured logbook where team members could log their tasks, hours worked, and any challenges faced during their work hours. This practice helped us:

- **Monitor Progress**: Keeping track of weekly session activities allowed us to monitor progress closely and identify any potential delays early.
- **Promote Accountability**: The logbook encouraged accountability among team members, as everyone was aware that their work hours were being recorded.
- **Optimize Resource Allocation**: By understanding how time was being spent, we could allocate resources more effectively and ensure that no time was wasted.

- **Facilitate Reflection and Improvement**: Regularly reviewing the logbook entries helped us reflect on our work patterns and make improvements where necessary.
