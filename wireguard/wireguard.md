# WireGuard
## why wireguard
- Speed: WireGuard is generally faster than OpenVPN due to the efficient and modern cryptography it uses. This results in lower latency and higher throughput speeds.
- Efficiency: WireGuard is lightweight and requires fewer resources, leading to better performance, especially on less powerful hardware.
- Configuration: WireGuard is often easier to configure and manage. Using static IP addresses and fixed keys can be simpler than setting up OpenVPN’s extensive settings.
- Kernel Integration: WireGuard is integrated into the Linux kernel, making it easier to install and use on Linux systems.
- Very good for point to point connection.
